## **Overview:**

Building a strong partnership with the Legal department is crucial for the success of an Insider Threat program. Legal teams provide critical guidance on compliance, regulatory requirements, privacy concerns, and policies that govern investigations. This collaboration ensures that insider threat activities remain within legal and ethical boundaries, reducing organizational liability.
