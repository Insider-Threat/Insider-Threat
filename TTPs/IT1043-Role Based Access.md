## **Overview:**  

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a **security best practice** that ensures employees and contractors have **only the necessary access** required to perform their job functions. By **restricting access to sensitive data, systems, and applications**, organizations can **minimize the risk of insider threats, accidental data exposure, and unauthorized access.**  

RBAC aligns **user permissions with job roles**, enforcing the principle of **least privilege** to limit excessive access. It also helps with **regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX)** by reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure.

## **Example Scenario:**  

| **Name**                         | **Description**                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excessive Privileges**         | A **new hire in HR** is mistakenly given **administrator access to financial systems**, allowing them to view confidential salary data. |
| **Privilege Creep**              | An employee moves from **IT Help Desk to Security Operations**, but **retains their previous access** to employee records, violating least privilege principles. |
| **Unauthorized Access Attempt**  | A **sales associate** attempts to access **engineering documents** unrelated to their job role, triggering an access violation alert. |

---

## **Mitigations**  

1. **Implement RBAC policies** to ensure employees only have access to the data and systems required for their role.  
2. **Conduct regular access reviews** to revoke unnecessary or excessive permissions.  
3. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to strengthen security for privileged accounts.  
4. **Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) access controls** to grant temporary access to sensitive systems when needed.  
5. **Monitor role changes** to ensure permissions are updated when employees switch departments or leave the company.  
6. **Audit and log all access requests and approvals** to ensure accountability.

## **Groups Applied To:**  

| **Group Name**                | **Monitoring (Yes/No)** |
|--------------------------------|:----------------------:|
| R&D                            | Yes/No               |
| Sales                          | Yes/No               |
| Executives and Executive Assistants | Yes/No         |
| IT Operations/InfoSec          | Yes/No               |
| Support Staff/Everyone Else    | Yes/No               |

## **Detection**  

| **Name**                          | **Description**                                                                 | **Link**          | **Risk Score** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|:--------------:|
| **Excessive Privilege Alert**      | Flags employees with **access beyond their role’s requirements**.              | [Example Link](#) | High           |
| **Unauthorized Access Attempt Alert** | Detects attempts to **access restricted systems or data**.                     | [Example Link](#) | Medium         |
| **Privilege Creep Alert**          | Identifies employees **retaining unnecessary access** after role changes.       | [Example Link](#) | High           |
| **Unusual Access Pattern Alert**   | Flags users **accessing data outside their normal job function**.               | [Example Link](#) | Medium         |

### **Additional Considerations**  

1. **Why It’s Critical:**  
   - Enforcing **least privilege** prevents **insider threats, privilege abuse, and accidental data breaches**.  
   - Many **cyberattacks escalate through excessive privileges**, making RBAC a key security control.  

2. **Broader Monitoring:**  
   - Integrate **RBAC policies with Identity & Access Management (IAM)** solutions for automated enforcement.  
   - Use **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)** to detect anomalies in access requests and privilege escalations.
