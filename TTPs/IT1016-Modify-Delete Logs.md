## **Overview:**
Logging exists to help identify what a user is doing and how an application/device is operating. Attempting to or editing a log file is highly irregular and not something we would expect to see happen. By editing these logs, a user could then conceal the true activity that took place. 


## **Example Scenario:**

| Name | Description |
| :---:| :---:|
| Concealing Activity | A user deletes activity in the logs that show they performed an unauthorized change to a system in an attempt to conceal their involvement in a serious business outage.   |
  

## **Mitigations**

1. Access control that prevents a user from modifying logs or the level of logging available.
