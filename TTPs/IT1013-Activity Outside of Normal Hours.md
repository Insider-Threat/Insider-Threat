## **Overview:**
Most employees follow a standard pattern of behavior based on their job function. By establishing behavioral norms for an employee, we can use this a way to identify anomalous activity.
## **Example Scenario:**

| Name | Description |
| :---:| :---:|
| Employee Collecting Data | An employee works Monday through Friday from 9am to 6pm, on Sunday at 10:39am there is a login event and then a file share is browsed and multiple files are accessed. This could be an indication that the employee is waiting for a time when there would be around to question their activity.  |
  

## **Mitigations**

1. Restrict access to sensitive information.
