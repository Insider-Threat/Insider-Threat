## **Overview:**
The ability to identify and investigate anomalous activity prior to an employee departing the Company, is critical to preventing the loss of sensitive and/or valuable data. Deviations from an employee's normal behavior, may be an indication that they have, or are trying to, access data they would not normally do in the course of their normal duties. 



## **Example Scenario:**

| Name | Description |
| :---:| :---:|
| Employee Resignation  | An employee has resigned and is leaving the Company, during the time between when the notice was delivered and their final day, the employee tries to access Applications they have never attempted to access before. They also are browsing file shares and downloading a large volume of files. |
  

## **Mitigations**

1. Once an employee has given their notice or was given notice, access to all sensitive applications and files should be revoked.
