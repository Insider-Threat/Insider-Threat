## **Overview:**

Building a strong partnership with the Human Resources (HR) department is essential for an effective Insider Threat program. HR collaboration provides valuable insights into key policies, stakeholders, and employee status, including Performance Improvement Plans (PIP), disciplinary actions, and layoffs. This information helps security teams proactively address potential insider threats and improve investigative capabilities.

## **Example Scenario:**

| **Name**              | **Description**                                                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disciplinary Action Alert | HR informs the Insider Threat team about an employee facing termination due to repeated policy violations. This prompts closer monitoring of the individualâ€™s activities. |
| Layoff Risk Monitoring  | HR notifies the Insider Threat team about a department-wide layoff. Security increases monitoring of impacted employees for data exfiltration attempts. |

---

## **Mitigations**

1. Establish regular communication channels between HR and the Insider Threat team to share relevant updates.  
2. Develop workflows to ensure timely notification of employees under disciplinary actions or PIPs.  
3. Implement access restrictions for employees flagged by HR to minimize risk.  
4. Conduct cross-functional training with HR to align on insider threat prevention strategies.
