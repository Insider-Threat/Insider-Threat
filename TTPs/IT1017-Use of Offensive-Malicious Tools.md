## **Overview:**

The possession or use of malware and offensive/penetration testing tools is restricted to individuals who require these tools for their official job responsibilities. Unauthorized use or installation of such tools can cause significant damage, including data breaches, privilege escalation, or disruption of critical systems. Monitoring for and mitigating the unauthorized use of these tools is essential to protect company assets and maintain security integrity.

## **Example Scenario:**

| **Name**                      | **Description**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detection of Malicious Tools  | A user who was passed over for a promotion installs ransomware on their laptop, connects to the corporate network, and executes the malware, causing a widespread infection. |
| Unauthorized Penetration Testing Tool Usage | An employee downloads and installs penetration testing software, such as Metasploit, without approval, attempting to scan internal systems for vulnerabilities. |

## **Mitigations**

1. Enforce endpoint protection policies to prevent the installation or execution of unapproved software.  
2. Implement network protection measures to block traffic associated with unauthorized protocols or applications.  
3. Regularly review software inventories on corporate devices to detect unauthorized tools.  
4. Deploy application control policies that restrict the execution of offensive or malicious tools to approved users.  
5. Provide training to employees about acceptable use policies and the risks of using unauthorized tools.
