## **Overview:**

Former employees who have left the company, especially those now working for competitors, may contact current employees to solicit sensitive information, proprietary data, or encourage them to leave the company. These interactions can occur via email, messaging apps, or social media. Detecting and investigating such correspondence is critical to safeguarding sensitive data and mitigating insider threat risks.

## **Example Scenario:**

| **Name**                       | **Description**                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Former Employee Communications | An employee leaves to work for a competitor and then reaches out to former colleagues, asking them to share proprietary product designs. |
| Recruitment to Competitor      | A former employee contacts a current employee, encouraging them to leave the company and bring along client lists or sensitive project data. |
| Collaborative Breach           | A former employee collaborates with a current employee to access sensitive systems by sharing login credentials or exploiting existing access. |

## **Mitigations**

1. Implement email monitoring and alerting for communication with domains associated with competitors or known former employees.  
2. Provide training to employees about the risks of sharing company information with former employees and the legal implications of such actions.  
3. Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to block unauthorized sharing of sensitive files or data through email or messaging platforms.  
4. Monitor access to sensitive systems or data for anomalies when correspondence with known former employees is detected.  
5. Collaborate with HR to maintain an up-to-date list of former employees, including high-risk departures (e.g., those who joined competitors).

### **Additional Considerations**

1. **Why Itâ€™s Critical**:
   - Correspondence with former employees is often overlooked but poses significant risks, especially if the former employee works for a competitor or departed under contentious circumstances.
   - Current employees may unknowingly or intentionally share information, making detection and prevention crucial.

2. **Broader Monitoring**:
   - Monitor social media platforms like LinkedIn, where former employees may reach out to current employees.  
   - Implement stricter controls on sharing sensitive data outside approved channels.

3. **Employee Communication Policies**:
   - Reinforce acceptable communication guidelines, especially concerning sharing work-related information with external parties, including former employees.
