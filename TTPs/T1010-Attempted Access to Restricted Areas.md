## **Overview:**
Access to areas is based off of job requirements, and employees should be attempting to access secure areas unless they possess the proper access levels. By gaining access to these sensitive areas, an employee can possibly acquire information that they should not be able to access under normal conditions.
## **Example Scenario:**

| Name | Description |
| :---:| :---:|
| Unauthorized Access Secure Area | An employee is trying to get into a secure area where a confidential meeting is taking place, they attempt several times to enter the area but do not have access. They then wait for a group of people who have access and follow behind them into the restricted area. |
