## **Overview:**

Preventing insider threats is a cornerstone of any security program.

A well-informed workforce can serve as the first line of defense.

1. Provide regular training sessions on insider threat awareness, company policies, and security best practices.  
2. Create clear and easily accessible documentation for employees to reference regarding insider threat policies.  
3. Develop an anonymous reporting system to encourage employees to report suspicious activity without fear of retaliation.  
4. Conduct frequent security awareness campaigns to reinforce critical messages and updates.
