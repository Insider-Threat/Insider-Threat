## **Overview:**  

Building a strong partnership with the **Privacy Team** is essential for developing a successful **Insider Threat Program** while ensuring compliance with **privacy laws, regulations, and corporate policies**.  

Privacy teams provide guidance on **handling personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, healthcare records, and other sensitive information**. This collaboration helps establish **operational boundaries**, ensuring that insider threat monitoring and investigations align with **legal and ethical standards** while maintaining transparency.  

Working closely with the Privacy Team ensures that **data collection, monitoring, and investigations** are performed **without violating employee rights, regulatory obligations, or customer trust**.
