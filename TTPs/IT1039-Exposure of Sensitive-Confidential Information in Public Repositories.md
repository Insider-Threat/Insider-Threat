## **Overview:**  

Employees with access to sensitive or confidential company data may, either intentionally or accidentally, expose this data by uploading it to public repositories. This can include **source code, internal documentation, customer data, intellectual property, trade secrets, or personally identifiable information (PII).**  

Accidental misconfigurations, such as open Amazon S3 buckets or misconfigured Git repositories, have led to significant breaches in various industries. Malicious actors also intentionally leak data for financial gain, retaliation, or corporate espionage. Proactively monitoring for leaks and enforcing data protection policies is crucial to mitigating these risks.

## **Example Scenario:**  

| **Name**                          | **Description**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intentional Posting of Data**   | A disgruntled employee uploads confidential source code to a public GitHub repository to harm the company. |
| **Unintentional Data Disclosure** | An employee mistakenly stores an HR file containing PII in an S3 bucket without proper access restrictions, making it publicly accessible. |
| **Leaked API Keys & Credentials** | A developer unknowingly commits code containing API keys and database credentials to a public repository, exposing critical systems to attack. |
| **Unauthorized Open-Source Sharing** | An engineer shares internal scripts or tools on an open-source platform without approval, inadvertently exposing proprietary technology. |

---

## **Mitigations**  

1. **Restrict access** to sensitive/confidential data by enforcing role-based access controls (RBAC) and least privilege principles.  
2. Implement **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** solutions to scan for and block uploads of sensitive information to public repositories.  
3. Enforce **code review and repository access policies** to ensure that internal repositories remain private and protected.  
4. Use **automated scanning tools** to detect exposed credentials, API keys, and sensitive data in code commits.  
5. Conduct **regular security audits** of cloud storage configurations (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) to identify public exposure risks.  
6. Provide **developer security training** on secure coding practices and the risks of exposing sensitive data in public repositories.

## **Detection**  

| **Name**                                | **Description**                                                                 | **Link**          | **Risk Score** |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|:--------------:|
| **Public Repository Data Leak Alert**   | Monitors for company-owned data appearing in public GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories. | [Example Link](#) | High           |
| **API Key Exposure Alert**              | Scans code commits for hardcoded API keys, credentials, or sensitive tokens.  | [Example Link](#) | High           |
| **Cloud Storage Misconfiguration Alert** | Detects publicly accessible S3 buckets, Azure blobs, or other storage misconfigurations. | [Example Link](#) | High           |
| **DLP File Upload Alert**               | Identifies and blocks attempts to upload sensitive documents to unauthorized locations. | [Example Link](#) | Medium         |

### **Additional Considerations**  

1. **Why Itâ€™s Critical:**  
   - Public data leaks can result in **financial losses, regulatory penalties (GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS), intellectual property theft, and reputational damage.**  
   - Attackers actively monitor public repositories for leaked credentials, which can lead to **data breaches, account takeovers, and unauthorized access.**  

2. **Broader Monitoring:**  
   - Integrate **threat intelligence feeds** to monitor external sources for exposed company data.  
   - Use **SIEM tools** to correlate suspicious file transfers with user behavior analytics (UBA) to detect potential insider threats.  
   - Employ **automated playbooks** for incident response, such as revoking exposed API keys or notifying security teams of newly discovered leaks.
