## Maturity Matrix

An insider threat program maturity matrix is an essential tool for organizations that want to effectively manage the risks associated with employees or other insiders who may intentionally or unintentionally cause harm to the organization. 

The matrix provides a framework for assessing the organization's current state of readiness in terms of policies, procedures, and technologies designed to detect and prevent insider threats. 

By using a maturity matrix, organizations can identify gaps in their current program and prioritize areas for improvement. This helps them to build a more comprehensive and effective insider threat program that can reduce the risk of incidents and protect the organization's critical assets. 

Ultimately, a mature insider threat program can help organizations to maintain their reputation, minimize financial losses, and comply with regulations and industry standards.
